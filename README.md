# Calculator-reactjs
In this project I created a calculator web app using reactjs and css. It has all the basic functionalities of a calculator like addition, subtraction, divison and multiplication. Its display consists of two values one being the user input and the other being the answer of currenty written values to kind of show what your expected output is.
